# Pokelyzer
Saves Pokemon from a specific location to analyze spawning behaviour

This project was created to get a better understand of how often different/same Pokemon spawn in a specific location.
Until now, only the "saving part" is implemented, no analysis is done yet.

If you want to use the project, be sure to update the Configurator.java file for you own needs!
